# PROPS.

The official said when you need to customize or create a componente with your own parameters, you are using `Props`.

Props should not be changed, It have a *"Immutable or Unchangeable"* behaivor.

You can associate this concept with class concept, becouse when you decleare a Components with own props in same when you created a class. Afther that you can use this code in differents ways with differentes arguments.

In the example, I created a class __"Queja"__ with __id,pic,descripcion__  how parameters. This structure was used in four differents ways and with differents parameters.

Look the code above.
