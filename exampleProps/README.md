# PROPS.

The official said when you need to customize or create a componente with your own parameters, you are using `Props`.

Props should not be changed, It have a *"Immutable or Unchangeable"* behaivor.

In the example, I created a component called __"Queja"__ with __id,pic,descripcion__  how parameters. This structure was used in four differents ways and with differents parameters.

Look the code in App.js file.
