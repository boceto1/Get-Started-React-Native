# PROPS

The official site said "when you need to customize or create a componente with your own parameters, you are using `Props`". Why?

Try to imagine the next situaci√≥n. We can to create a app to register people. What's atributtes people have ?

For this tutorial, we are goint to take _ID,NAME,PHOTO_ how properties.

Could be the name a person changed? or his id?The answer is no. This properties are immutable or unchangeable.  

That is __Props__, These are properties can't change while the app run, in other words. These have a *"Immutable or Unchangeable"* behaivor. 


In the example, I created a component called __"Person"__ with __id,pic,descripcion__  how parameters. This structure was used in four differents ways and with differents parameters.

Look the code in App.js file.
